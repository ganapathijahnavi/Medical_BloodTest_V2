This pattern may reflect significant chronic liver disease.\n\nClinical Significance:\n- Prolonged PT/INR suggests reduced production of clotting factors by the liver.\n- Mildly prolonged aPTT and platelets at the lower end of normal further support impaired coagulation.\n- Elevated AST and ALT indicate ongoing hepatocellular injury.\n- Elevated bilirubin and low albumin point toward compromised liver function and possible chronicity.\n\nPotential Risks (not a diagnosis):\n- Increased tendency for bleeding, especially with trauma or invasive procedures.\n- Progression of chronic liver disease to more advanced stages (e.g., cirrhosis, portal hypertension) if not controlled.\n\nLifestyle Recommendations:\n- Avoid alcohol completely unless a physician explicitly advises otherwise.\n- Do not take over-the-counter medications or herbal supplements without consulting a doctor, especially those potentially toxic to the liver.\n- Maintain a balanced diet to support nutritional needs; avoid high-salt intake if fluid retention is present.\n\nFollow-up / Doctor Advice:\n- Consult a hepatologist or gastroenterologist for comprehensive evaluation.\n- Additional investigations such as ultrasound, elastography, or other imaging may be recommended to assess liver structure.\n- Clotting parameters should be monitored and managed carefully, particularly before any procedures.\n- Under specialist guidance, a tailored management plan should be implemented for the underlying liver condition."
